# Chess.com Titled Tuesdays Winners Archive

This repository provides access to the winners of Chess.com's Titled Tuesdays tournaments through two sources:

- **Chess.com Tournament Page:** The most up-to-date results can be found on the [Chess.com Titled Tuesdays tournament page](https://www.chess.com/tournament/live/titled-tuesdays).

- **Wayback Machine Archive:** If you are looking for historical data and the Chess.com tournament page does not have the information you need, you can use the [Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org/web/20220301000000*/https://www.chess.com/tournament/live/titled-tuesdays) to access archived pages of the tournament results.

- **Older Events:** Later, I discovered the [Chess.com Titled Tuesday Historical Archive](https://www.chess.com/article/view/titled-tuesday-historical-archive), which contains a comprehensive list of older Titled Tuesdays events. Additionally, I've created a list of the tournament links available on [here](https://github.com/cmgchess/Titled-Tuesday-Data/issues/1).

- **PGN Files:** PGN files are available [here](https://www.mediafire.com/folder/6ez3624zqt6ot/titled-tuesday), courtesy of [chessnerd.net](https://chessnerd.net/).

- I have also written a [Python script](https://gist.github.com/cmgchess/1c18df5801184a54355b1bdeb0dceac4) to fetch games from a tournament.
