# Chess.com Titled Tuesdays Winners Archive

This repository provides access to the winners of Chess.com's Titled Tuesdays tournaments through two sources:

- **Chess.com Tournament Page:** The most up-to-date results can be found on the [Chess.com Titled Tuesdays tournament page](https://www.chess.com/tournament/live/titled-tuesdays). Please note that it's not possible to access results beyond page 6 for some reason.

- **Wayback Machine Archive:** If you are looking for historical data and the Chess.com tournament page does not have the information you need, you can use the [Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org/web/20220301000000*/https://www.chess.com/tournament/live/titled-tuesdays) to access archived pages of the tournament results.

- **Older Events:** Later, I discovered the [Chess.com Titled Tuesday Historical Archive](https://www.chess.com/article/view/titled-tuesday-historical-archive), which contains a comprehensive list of older Titled Tuesdays events. Additionally, I've created a list of the tournament links available on [here](https://github.com/cmgchess/Titled-Tuesday-Data/issues/1).
